# FirstCryptography

In this repository I will be sharing my first ever cryptography coding task.

It is based on the cryptography introduction video from Fireship

You will find the following javaScripts: 
**1. Hash**, meaning to chop and mix a number of any length into a number of fixed length looking like meaningless garbage.
**2. Salt**, is a random value that can be added to a message before hashing it to add extra security
**3. HMAC**, or hash-based message authentication code
**4. Symmetric Encryption**, allowing to also decipher the message after enciphering it
**5. Keypairs**, to design a public-key crypto system
**6. Asymmetric Encryption**, public-key encryption, private-key decryption
**7. Signing**, to verify the autenticity of the sender
